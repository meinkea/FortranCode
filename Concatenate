! this programs is a test on the addition of strings
program Strings
    Character (Len=5) :: str1, str2, strSUM*10
    print *, 'Please enter two 5 character strings'
    read(*,'(A)') str1
    read(*,'(A)') str2
    strSUM = str1 // str2  ! // is to concatenate two strings
    print *, 'The concatenation of ', str1, ' & ', str2, ' is:'
    print *, strSUM
end program Strings
!
! Putting a space in the string causes the concatenation ' // '
!   to become VERY unstable, coming up with rearanged letters
!
! Leaving out entries in the string causes the concatenation ' // '
!   to become VERY unstable, coming up with rearanged letters. I'm
!   thinking that this is a problem with my compiler, and not the
!   code itself.
